# Project

Classification of documents with a particular interest for ID and passport documents.


## Presentation

This repository contains the code for our project CLASSIFY_DOC, developed during our [Data Scientist training](https://datascientest.com/en/data-scientist-course) at [DataScientest](https://datascientest.com/).

The goal of this project is to classify documents (ID card, passport, salary slip, invoice, ...).

Two different ways to reach this goal :
- Computer Vision => Available in the notebook folder
- OCR + NLP       => Code available soon


## Streamlit App

A Streamlit App will be available in december 2022 for our project.

**Add explanations on how to use the app.**

To run the app :

```shell
cd streamlit_app
conda create --name my-awesome-streamlit python=3.9
conda activate my-awesome-streamlit
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

The app should then be available at [localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).

**Docker**

You can also run the Streamlit app in a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container. To do so, you will first need to build the Docker image :

```shell
cd streamlit_app
docker build -t streamlit-app .
```

You can then run the container using :

```shell
docker run --name streamlit-app -p 8501:8501 streamlit-app
```

And again, the app should then be available at [localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).
